# gas2asm
Convert gcc -S output to HLASM input.

This repository contains two utilities, `gas2asm` and `asmxpand`,
and a macro library that is needed for assembly of a program
that is generated by `gas2asm`.

`make check` verifies the conversion against a number of programs.

### Macros
The `macros` directory contains macros that are emitted by `gas2asm`.

`make install` copies these macros to `$HOME/macros`.

`make` generates a CMS MACLIB `fplg2a.maclib` containing the macros.
This requires the `maclib` utility from
https://github.com/jphartmann/CMS-TXTLIB.

`make all` uploads
`fplg2a.maclib` to your VM
system.
You must
define the environment variable `VMHOST` to the host name or IP address
of your VM system; your VM system must allow ftp; and you must have set up
your `.netrc` file to log on to your user ID.

Otherwise you must upload manually.
Use `bin` and `site fix 80` for manual ftp.
